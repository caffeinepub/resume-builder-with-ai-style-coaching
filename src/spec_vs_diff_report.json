  "summary": "The diff updates `frontend/src/App.tsx` to add an unauthenticated landing screen with a primary “Sign in with Internet Identity” button wired to `useInternetIdentity().login()`, including disabled/loading and error/retry behavior. It also adds additional landing UI (logo/title/tagline) not explicitly requested.",

    {
      "description": "Added unauthenticated landing/marketing UI elements (logo image, app title, tagline, gradient background) beyond the requested sign-in button/error state wiring.",
      "reason": "REQ-9 only requests adding a visible primary Internet Identity sign-in button (plus loading/disabled and error/retry behavior). The additional branding/hero UI is not requested and could conflict with the stated non-goal of not changing static image assets as part of this fix (even though no new asset files were added, the UI now references an asset path).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (adds <img src=\"/assets/generated/resume-coach-logo.dim_512x512.png\" ...>, header text, tagline, and background classes in the unauthenticated screen)"
